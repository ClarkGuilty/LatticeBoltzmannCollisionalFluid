# LatticeBoltzmannCollisionalFluid
Simulation of a self-interacting fluid using the Lattice-Boltzmann method in Julia. The collisional part will be added in future versions.

Reimplementation of <https://github.com/ClarkGuilty/CollisionalDarkMatterSimulation> in Julia with the ultimate objective of making it parallel.

Method proposed in <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02757.pdf>. This particular implementation is explained in <https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/bitstream/handle/1992/39260/u821160.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y>.
